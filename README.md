    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div>Web technology (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) is a must-have skill for software development today. 
        In fact, it is a foundation for all modern software solutions. Without a strong foundation in web 
        technology, engineers are unable to meet the product quality and delivery time. This workshop provides
         a strong foundation to learn any front-end framework like Angular or React.</div>
    <p>Though there are numerous courses available online, that are not effective as those trainings are long hours, 
        non-interactive and outdated. The external instructor (without real-time product/project development 
        experience) led trainings are not effective as well, as those trainings are packed with too many concepts 
        for a short period (2-3 Full day). This leaves the engineers with no time to practice their learning as 
        they are pressured with project deliverables. Also, the external trainers are not aware of the internal 
        project requirements and unable to relate to real-world problems</p>

        Hence, we need customized interactive internal hands-on workshops for our engineers.

        <h3>Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>
            <li>To provide a strong foundation on web technology – HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which they work on day, 
                night and sometimes over the weekends too)</li>
            <li>Explain the importance of software craftsmanship principles, disciplines, best coding principles and practices, DOs and DON’Ts, code reviews and code optimization by creating re-usable 
                code/functions/utility libraries or frameworks with live examples</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
